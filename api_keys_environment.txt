In Linux, you can make environment variables "sticky" or persistent across sessions 
by defining them in a profile file such as ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile.

Here's how you can make an environment variable persistent in Linux:

Open the profile file: Open the ~/.bashrc file in a text editor. 
If the file does not exist, create it.

Add the environment variable: Add the following line to the file, 
replacing MY_API_KEY with the name of your environment variable 
and 'a secret' with its value:

javascript
Copy code
export MY_API_KEY='a secret'
Save and close the file: Save the changes to the ~/.bashrc file 
and close the text editor.

Reload the profile: You can reload the profile file in the current shell 
by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
source ~/.bashrc
Verify the environment variable: You can verify that the environment variable 
has been set correctly by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
echo $MY_API_KEY
Now the environment variable MY_API_KEY will be set every time you log in 
to the system.

Access the environment variable in Python: 
You can access the value of an environment variable in Python 
using the os module, specifically the os.environ dictionary. For example:

java
Copy code
import os

api_key = os.environ.get('MY_API_KEY')
Use the environment variable: Once you have the value of 
the environment variable, you can use it in your code as needed. For example:

python
Copy code
print("My API key is:", api_key)
This way, you can use environment variables to store sensitive information 
like API keys, and avoid hard-coding them in your code. 
This helps improve the security of your application, as well as making 
it easier to manage and change API keys as needed.
